# Enhanced Leaderboard Features

## Overview

The Papers with Code application now includes an enhanced leaderboard system that tracks cumulative best performance over time, providing valuable insights into the progression of AI/ML research.

## Key Features

### 1. Cumulative Best Performance Tracking

The leaderboard now maintains a chronological record of the best performance achieved for each dataset and task combination. This allows users to see:

- **Performance Progression**: How the state-of-the-art has improved over time
- **Breakthrough Moments**: When significant improvements were made
- **Research Trends**: The pace of advancement in different areas

### 2. Visual Performance Chart

A new interactive chart component shows:

- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of performance improvements
- **Timeline View**: Chronological display of record-breaking models
- **Improvement Metrics**: Total improvement and time span statistics

### 3. Enhanced Table Features

The leaderboard table now includes:

- **New Record Indicators**: Green highlighting and special icons for record-breaking performances
- **Cumulative Best Column**: Shows the best performance achieved up to that point in time
- **Chronological Sorting**: Results are sorted by date to show progression
- **Visual Distinctions**: Different styling for new records vs. current top performers

## How It Works

### Data Processing

1. **Chronological Sorting**: All evaluations are sorted by date (oldest first)
2. **Cumulative Tracking**: The system tracks the best performance achieved at each point in time
3. **Record Detection**: New records are identified when performance exceeds the previous best
4. **Metric Normalization**: Handles different metric formats (percentages, decimals, etc.)

### Visual Indicators

- **üèÜ Trophy**: Current top 3 performers
- **üèÖ Award**: New record breakers
- **üìà Trending Up**: Performance improvements
- **‚≠ê Star**: Historical milestones

## Usage

1. Navigate to the "Leaderboards" tab
2. Select a dataset (e.g., ImageNet)
3. Select a task (e.g., Image Classification)
4. View the performance chart and detailed table
5. Hover over elements for additional information

## Technical Implementation

### Components

- `LeaderboardTable`: Main leaderboard component with cumulative tracking
- `PerformanceChart`: Visual chart showing performance progression
- `useLeaderboard`: Hook for fetching leaderboard data

### Data Flow

1. Backend API provides evaluation data
2. Frontend processes data chronologically
3. Cumulative best performance is calculated
4. Visual components render the processed data

## Benefits

- **Research Insights**: Understand the pace of AI advancement
- **Historical Context**: See how current models compare to historical benchmarks
- **Breakthrough Identification**: Easily spot significant improvements
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in research progress

## Future Enhancements
