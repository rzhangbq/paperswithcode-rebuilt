# Database Cleaning Scripts

This directory contains scripts to clean spam and problematic data directly from the Papers with Code SQLite database.

## Files

- `clean_database.py` - Main database cleaning script
- `run_db_cleaning.py` - Interactive script to run cleaning operations
- `README_DB_CLEANING.md` - This file

## Quick Start

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
cd data
python run_db_cleaning.py
```

This will show you a menu of options to:
1. Find and preview spam entries
2. Delete spam entries
3. Clean text fields
4. Find and preview duplicates
5. Remove duplicate entries
6. Show database statistics

### Command Line Mode

#### Find spam entries (dry run)
```bash
python clean_database.py --dry-run
```

#### Delete spam entries
```bash
python clean_database.py
```

#### Clean text fields (remove spam elements)
```bash
python clean_database.py --clean-text --dry-run  # Preview changes
python clean_database.py --clean-text            # Apply changes
```

#### Remove duplicates
```bash
python clean_database.py --remove-duplicates --dry-run  # Preview changes
python clean_database.py --remove-duplicates            # Apply changes
```

## What Gets Cleaned

### Spam Detection
The script identifies spam entries based on:

1. **Suspicious patterns in names:**
   - Triple hash marks (`###`)
   - Airline-related keywords (`cancel`, `refund`, `airline`)

2. **Phone number spam:**
   - Excessive phone numbers (more than 3)
   - Phone emojis (`ðŸ“ž`)
   - Specific spam phone patterns

3. **Spam keywords:**
   - Airline: `cancel`, `refund`, `airline`, `lufthansa`, `booking`, `ticket`, `travel`, `flight`
   - Phone spam: `call`, `phone`, `helpline`, `customer service`
   - Generic spam: `click here`, `buy now`, `limited time`, `act now`

4. **Repetitive content:**
   - Text with too many repeated words

### Text Cleaning
When cleaning text (instead of deleting), the script removes:
- Phone numbers
- Phone emojis
- Triple hash marks
- Excessive whitespace

### Duplicate Detection
Finds duplicates based on:
- Identical names
- Identical descriptions

## Safety Features

1. **Dry Run Mode**: Always preview changes before applying them
2. **Confirmation Prompts**: Interactive mode asks for confirmation before deleting
3. **Database Backup**: Consider backing up your database before cleaning
4. **Transaction Safety**: All changes are wrapped in database transactions

## Database Statistics

The script shows statistics for all tables:
- **papers**: Research papers
- **datasets**: Datasets used in research
- **methods**: Machine learning methods
- **evaluations**: Task evaluations
- **code_links**: Links to code repositories

## Troubleshooting

### Database not found
Make sure you're running the script from the `data` directory where `papers_with_code.db` is located.

### Permission errors
Ensure you have read/write permissions for the database file.

### Large database
For very large databases, the cleaning process may take several minutes. The script shows progress information.

## Backup Recommendations

Before running any cleaning operations, consider backing up your database:

```bash
cp papers_with_code.db papers_with_code_backup.db
```

## Advanced Usage

You can also use the `clean_database.py` script directly with custom options:

```bash
# Use a different database file
python clean_database.py --db /path/to/your/database.db

# Combine operations
python clean_database.py --clean-text --remove-duplicates --dry-run
```

## What the Script Does

1. **Connects to SQLite database**
2. **Scans datasets table** for problematic entries
3. **Applies cleaning rules** based on spam detection patterns
4. **Shows preview** of what would be changed (dry run mode)
5. **Applies changes** to database (when not in dry run mode)
6. **Reports statistics** before and after cleaning

The script is designed to be safe and reversible - always run with `--dry-run` first to see what would be changed!
